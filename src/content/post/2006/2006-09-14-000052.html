</ul>
<h3>Presentation of the XML document</h3>
<p>　　The presentation should be realized with XSL and in an Internet browser. You have to develop <strong>FIVE</strong> XSL files delivering information on<ul>
<li>Conference venue (venue.xsl)</li>
<li>Organising committee (committee.xsl)</li>

<table border="0">
<tr>
<td>1. XML file</td>
<td>name: ecis_conference.xml</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. DTD file</td>
<td>name: ecis_dtd.dtd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. XML Schema file</td>
<td>name: ecis_schema.xsd</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. XSL file 1</td>
<td>name: venue.xsl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. XSL file 2</td>
<td>name: committee.xsl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. XSL file 3</td>
<td>name: tracks.xsl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. XSL file 4</td>
<td>name: program.xsl</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>8. XSL file 5</td>
<td>name: merge.xsl</td>
</tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>　　有点看不懂，这个题目意思好像是把所有信息放到一个 xml 文件里，然后不同 xsl 文件从这个 xml 中读取数据并表现出来。xsl 有读取 xml 文件的语法嘛？我只知道不同内容、相同格式的 xml 文件调用一个 xsl 文件来表现自己的数据，可以反过来？好像除非在另一个页面里用 JS 载入不通的 xsl，通过 JS 打印出来才行吧……征集答案 -_-</p>
